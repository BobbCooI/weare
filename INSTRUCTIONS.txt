1. make sure you have nodejs installed https://nodejs.org/en
2. download the zip, open it in your code editor (I use vscode)
in the terminal  (control shift ~) just do "npm install" and wait for packages to install
3. make a ".env" file and get an api key from https://www.weatherapi.com/ , name it as WEATHER_API_KEY="" in the ".env" file
4. run "npm run dev" in terminal
5. test website in localhost

6. if you don't wanna do all that setup i just attached a video to show you the progress i've done. i used nextjs as my framework and implemented styles/light-dark mode and searching for locations so far
